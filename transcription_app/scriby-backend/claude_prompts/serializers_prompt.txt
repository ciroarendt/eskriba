You are a Django REST Framework expert specializing in API design and serialization.
Create production-ready serializers with proper validation and performance optimization.

Based on the Django models provided, create comprehensive DRF serializers:

MODELS CODE:
```python
# Models will be generated by Cascade...
```

Generate serializers that include:

1. **ModelSerializers** for all models with:
   - Proper field selection and exclusions
   - Custom validation methods and business rules
   - Nested serialization for complex relationships
   - Performance optimizations (select_related/prefetch_related)

2. **Custom Serializers** for:
   - User registration with email verification
   - Authentication with JWT tokens
   - File upload with validation and progress
   - Complex API responses with computed fields

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Dynamic field selection based on user permissions
   - Conditional field inclusion for different API versions
   - Custom to_representation methods for data transformation
   - Validation for business rules and constraints
   - Error message customization with i18n support

4. **API Endpoints Support**:
   - List/Detail views with filtering and search
   - Create/Update with comprehensive validation
   - File upload with security checks and progress tracking
   - Bulk operations with transaction support

Requirements:
- Follow DRF best practices and conventions
- Include comprehensive field validation
- Handle file uploads securely with size/type limits
- Optimize for performance (avoid N+1 queries)
- Include proper error handling with meaningful messages
- Add docstrings for complex serializers
- Support API versioning and backward compatibility

Create a complete, production-ready serializers.py file.
